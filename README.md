The ultimate solution for keystore manipulation in Android

Tired of deal with Android keystore? A lot of code ever? This library is for you

This library is tiny (no dependencies) just to small implementations to store/retrieve keystore values
it automatically deals with old Android keystore implementation (pre api 23) and newer Android keystore

Usage:
---
```java
//Just get a instance of the CipherStorage
CipherStorage cipherStorage = CipherStorageFactory.newInstance(context);
//Then you can use the encrypt and decrypt method
```

Gradle dependency:
---
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.leonardoxh:keystore-ultimate:1.2.1'
```

...Unit tests?
---
* I care a lot about unit tests, and since this library touch on the Android Keystore
making it almost impossible to test, but, I said "almost" that's why I provide another library
just for tests, if you wanna use mockito `when...then` it's fine but I think this is not 
your responsability so just add this into your test implementation and that's it, the 
`CipherStorageFactory` will return a in memory implementation just for tests you don't need change
anything on your source code:
```groovy
testImplementation 'com.github.leonardoxh:keystore-ultimate-test:1.2.1'
```

Library usage?
---
* Did you use this library? Please notify me via email leonardoxh@gmail.com I would love to receive feedbacks and see if this library is used in some project and if it's helping somehow.

Inspiration:
---
* [React native keychain](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-keychain)

Limitations:
---
* On Api level 22 and bellow your alias for key should not contain more than 256 bytes otherwise we can't save
the the value due a limitation on the Android Keystore
